This website is a collection of my writings. 

I am a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. I currently work on [Quantum Ledger Database](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/).

I love building clean and simple systems -- systems that solve the right problems.

I am heavily self taught. I have an acute thirst for learning. I am also a graduate of [Year Up](https://www.yearup.org/) -- 
a one-year tech boot camp -- and Amazon Technical Academy -- a one-year software engineering immersive.
