This website is a collection of my writings. 

I am a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. I currently work on [Quantum Ledger Database](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/).

I love to build clean and simple systems. Systems that solve the right problems.

I'm heavily self taught. I have an acute thirst for learning. I'm also a graduate of [Year Up](https://www.yearup.org) -- 
a one year tech boot camp -- and Amazon Technical Academy -- a one year software engineering immersive.
